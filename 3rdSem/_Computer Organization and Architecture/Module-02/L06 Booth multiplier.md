## Notes

### 1. Motivation

The shift-and-add algorithm works only for **unsigned** numbers. For **signed** multiplication (twos complement), Booth's algorithm provides a systematic method that handles both positive and negative multipliers uniformly. Additionally, Booth's algorithm can be faster for certain bit patterns by skipping over strings of 1s.

### 2. Booth Recoding (Radix-2)

Booth's algorithm examines **two adjacent bits** of the multiplier at a time (current bit Qi and previous bit Qi-1). Based on the pattern, the multiplicand is added, subtracted, or left unchanged.

#### Encoding Table

| Qi | Qi-1 | Operation on Multiplicand |
|----|------|---------------------------|
| 0  | 0    | Add 0 (no operation)      |
| 0  | 1    | Add multiplicand (+M)     |
| 1  | 0    | Subtract multiplicand (-M)|
| 1  | 1    | Add 0 (no operation)      |

- Qi = current bit (bit i of multiplier)
- Qi-1 = previous bit (bit i-1, with Q-1 = 0 initially)

The subtract operation is performed by adding the twos complement of M.

#### Recoding Interpretation

Booth recoding transforms the multiplier bits into a signed-digit representation. For example, the multiplier 0111 (7) can be recoded as:

- 0111 in Booth encoding: examine bit pairs with Qi-1 starting at 0.
  - Q3=0, Q2=1 (bits 3,2 with Q1): (0,1,1) -> (0 - 1)*2^2 + (1 - 0)*2^1 + (1 - 0)*2^0 = ?
  
Actually, the simpler view: Booth recoding produces digits from the set {-1, 0, +1}. Each digit = Qi - Qi-1.

For multiplier Q = 0111 (n=4):
- Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 0 1 1 1, Q-1 = 0 (initial)
- Recoding:
  - Q0 - Q-1 = 1 - 0 = +1
  - Q1 - Q0 = 1 - 1 = 0
  - Q2 - Q1 = 1 - 1 = 0
  - Q3 - Q2 = 0 - 1 = -1
  - Q4 - Q3 = 0 - 0 = 0 (for completeness)

Recoded multiplier: 0 -1 0 0 +1 (bits from MSB to LSB).

This means: -1 x 2^3 + 0 x 2^2 + 0 x 2^1 + 1 x 2^0 = -8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = -7... That's not right for +7.

Wait, the recoding is: +1 at position 0, 0 at position 1, 0 at position 2, -1 at position 3.
Value = 1 x 2^0 + 0 x 2^1 + 0 x 2^2 + (-1) x 2^3 = 1 - 8 = -7.

But the original multiplier was +7 (0111). This seems wrong. Let me check.

Actually, when extending to 5 bits, 0111 becomes 00111. Q4=0 (sign extended). Q-1=0.

- Q0 - Q-1 = 1 - 0 = +1
- Q1 - Q0 = 1 - 1 = 0
- Q2 - Q1 = 1 - 1 = 0
- Q3 - Q2 = 0 - 1 = -1
- Q4 - Q3 = 0 - 0 = 0

Sum = +1 - 8 = -7. But 0111 = +7. Something is off.

Actually, the Booth recoding yields digits {-1, 0, +1} but the value represented is the same as the original multiplier. Let me recalculate. For 0111 (7):

The standard interpretation: Booth recoding groups bits so the value is preserved. For Q = 0111:
- 0111 = 1000 - 0001 = -8 + 1 = -7? No, that's wrong. Let me think again.

Actually, the Booth recoding for 0111:
- Scan from LSB to MSB
- Qi Qi-1:
  - 1 0 (Q0=1, Q-1=0): +M
  - 1 1 (Q1=1, Q0=1): 0
  - 1 1 (Q2=1, Q1=1): 0
  - 0 1 (Q3=0, Q2=1): -M

The contributions are at position 0 (+M * 2^0) and position 3 (-M * 2^3). This is equivalent to M * (1 - 8) = -7M. But that would give -7 * M for a multiplier of +7? That can't be right.

Wait, the issue is that in Booth's algorithm, the operations happen at different positions (word shifts). The algorithm scans the multiplier and for each transition (0->1 or 1->0), it adds or subtracts the multiplicand at the appropriate position. So for 0111 (which is 7):

- Start with Q-1 = 0, multiplier Q = 0111
- Scan Q0=1, Q-1=0 => 1,0 transition => subtract M (start of run of 1s)
- Scan Q1=1, Q0=1 => 1,1 => no operation (middle of run)
- Scan Q2=1, Q1=1 => 1,1 => no operation (middle of run)
- Scan Q3=0, Q2=1 => 0,1 transition => add M (end of run of 1s)

So we get: -M at position 0 and +M at position 3. Result = M * (-1 + 8) = 7M. Correct!

The Booth encoding yields: 0 0 0 -1 (with +1 at the implied bit 4 for sign handling, or equivalently -1 at pos 0 and +1 at pos 3).

So the recoded multiplier digits (from LSB to MSB): -1, 0, 0, +1
Value = -1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^3 = -1 + 8 = 7. Correct!

I had the ordering wrong earlier. The digit at position i is not Qi - Qi-1 exactly. Let me reconsider.

The standard Booth recoding: digit d_i = Qi - Qi-1, where Q-1 = 0.
For Q = 0111:
- d_0 = Q0 - Q-1 = 1 - 0 = +1
- d_1 = Q1 - Q0 = 1 - 1 = 0
- d_2 = Q2 - Q1 = 1 - 1 = 0
- d_3 = Q3 - Q2 = 0 - 1 = -1

Value = d_0 * 2^0 + d_1 * 2^1 + d_2 * 2^2 + d_3 * 2^3 = 1 + 0 + 0 + (-1)*8 = 1 - 8 = -7.

But multiplier is 0111 = +7. So the recoding gives -7?? There's a contradiction.

The resolution: For a 4-bit number, the Booth algorithm actually requires an extra bit (sign extension). Q should be 0 0 1 1 1 (5 bits, sign extended from 4-bit 0111). So:

- d_0 = Q0 - Q-1 = 1 - 0 = +1
- d_1 = Q1 - Q0 = 1 - 1 = 0
- d_2 = Q2 - Q1 = 1 - 1 = 0
- d_3 = Q3 - Q2 = 0 - 1 = -1
- d_4 = Q4 - Q3 = 0 - 0 = 0

Value = 1 + 0 + 0 + (-1)*8 + 0 = 1 - 8 = -7.

Still -7. Something is fundamentally off in my understanding. Let me look at this differently.

Actually, I believe the confusion is because I'm thinking of the recoded value as the same as the original, but the Booth recoding for 0111 should give:

d_3 = -1, d_2 = 0, d_1 = 0, d_0 = +1

The original multiplier Q = 0111 = 7.
The recoded sequence: -1 at position 3, +1 at position 0.

These encode the same number through a different representation. Let me verify:
The number represented by Booth digits is: Sum(d_i * 2^i)
= 1 * 2^0 + (-1) * 2^3
= 1 - 8
= -7

But Q = +7. So the recoding does NOT preserve value if we naively sum. The issue is that Booth algorithm's digits have a specific meaning in context of the multiplication algorithm.

OK, I think the correct interpretation is: the Booth recoding gives the **multiplier value** when properly interpreted. Let me re-examine.

Actually, I think the standard formula is correct and I'm making an error. For 4-bit numbers, the range is -8 to 7. The number 7 is representable, but when we Booth-recode, the algorithm implicitly uses an extra (sign) bit.

With proper n-bit Booth: we examine Q with Q-1 = 0, and we examine n bit pairs (or n+1 bits with sign extension). The standard algorithm uses n steps (for n-bit multiplier) but needs the extra sign bit for proper recoding.

Let me just use the standard textbook approach properly.

Standard Booth algorithm for n-bit multiplier:
- Add a 0 to the right of Q (as Q-1).
- Perform n steps of examining Qi and Qi-1.

For Q = 0111 (4-bit +7):
Add Q-1 = 0: 0 1 1 1 0 (Qi from left to right: bits 3,2,1,0 and Q-1)
Step 1 (i=0): Q0=1, Q-1=0 => -M (1,0 transition)
Step 2 (i=1): Q1=1, Q0=1 => 0
Step 3 (i=2): Q2=1, Q1=1 => 0
Step 4 (i=3): Q3=0, Q2=1 => +M (0,1 transition)

This gives: -M at step 1 (shifted 0 positions) and +M at step 4 (shifted 3 positions). Result = M * (-1 + 8) = 7M. Correct!

The value is correct when interpreted within the algorithm. Sorry for the confusion in my earlier analysis. The recoded digit at each position corresponds to the operation at that step, not to a simple sum of 2^i * d_i that equals Q.

### 3. Booth Algorithm Steps

**Input**: Multiplicand M (n-bit, signed), Multiplier Q (n-bit, signed).  
**Output**: Product P (2n-bit).

1. Initialize:
   - A = 0 (n-bit accumulator)
   - Q = multiplier (n-bit)
   - Q-1 = 0 (1-bit register, initial value 0)
   - Count = n

2. Repeat n times:
   - Examine (Q0, Q-1):
     - 0,0: No operation
     - 0,1: A = A + M
     - 1,0: A = A - M (A = A + twos complement of M)
     - 1,1: No operation
   - Arithmetic right shift (A, Q, Q-1) by 1 bit.
     - The shift preserves the sign of A (MSB stays the same).
     - The LSB of A shifts into the MSB of Q.
     - The LSB of Q shifts into Q-1.
   - Count = Count - 1

3. After n iterations: Product = A concatenated with Q (2n bits).

### 4. Worked Example 1: (+2) x (+3)

M = 0010 (+2), Q = 0011 (+3), n = 4.

Initial: A = 0000, Q = 0011, Q-1 = 0, Count = 4.

| Iter | Q0 | Q-1 | Operation | A     | Q     | Q-1 | Count |
|------|----|-----|-----------|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| Init | -  | -   | -         | 0000  | 0011  | 0   | 4     |
| 1    | 1  | 0   | A = A - M | 1110  | 0011  | 0   |       |
| 1    |    |     | ASR       | 1111  | 0001  | 1   | 3     |
| 2    | 1  | 1   | No op     | 1111  | 0001  | 1   |       |
| 2    |    |     | ASR       | 1111  | 1000  | 1   | 2     |
| 3    | 0  | 1   | A = A + M | 0001  | 1000  | 1   | (1111+0010=0001, carry discarded) |
| 3    |    |     | ASR       | 0000  | 1100  | 0   | 1     |
| 4    | 0  | 0   | No op     | 0000  | 1100  | 0   |       |
| 4    |    |     | ASR       | 0000  | 0110  | 0   | 0     |

Product = A:Q = 0000 0110 = +6. Correct (2 x 3 = 6).

### 5. Worked Example 2: (-3) x (+5)

M = 1101 (-3), Q = 0101 (+5), n = 4.

Initial: A = 0000, Q = 0101, Q-1 = 0, Count = 4.
Twos complement of M: -M = 0011 (+3).

| Iter | Q0 | Q-1 | Operation | A     | Q     | Q-1 | Count |
|------|----|-----|-----------|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| Init | -  | -   | -         | 0000  | 0101  | 0   | 4     |
| 1    | 1  | 0   | A = A - M | 0011  | 0101  | 0   | (0 + 0011 = 0011) |
| 1    |    |     | ASR       | 0001  | 1010  | 1   | 3     |
| 2    | 0  | 1   | A = A + M | 1110  | 1010  | 1   | (0001+1101=1110) |
| 2    |    |     | ASR       | 1111  | 0101  | 0   | 2     |
| 3    | 1  | 0   | A = A - M | 0010  | 0101  | 0   | (1111+0011=0010, discard carry) |
| 3    |    |     | ASR       | 0001  | 0010  | 1   | 1     |
| 4    | 0  | 1   | A = A + M | 1110  | 0010  | 1   | (0001+1101=1110) |
| 4    |    |     | ASR       | 1111  | 0001  | 0   | 0     |

Product = A:Q = 1111 0001 = -15 (in 8-bit twos complement). Check: -3 x 5 = -15. Correct.

### 6. Why Booth's Algorithm Works

Booth's algorithm takes advantage of the property that a string of consecutive 1s in the multiplier (e.g., 0111) can be represented as a difference between two powers of two:
- 0111 = 1000 - 0001 = 2^3 - 2^0

So multiplying by 0111 is equivalent to:
- M x 0111 = M x (1000 - 0001) = M x 2^3 - M x 2^0
- This is: (M shifted left 3) - M

Booth's algorithm detects the start of a run of 1s (1,0 transition) and performs subtraction, and the end of a run (0,1 transition) and performs addition. This reduces the number of partial products for long strings of 1s.

#### Advantage Illustration

Compare standard shift-and-add vs Booth for M x 0111 (M x 7):

**Standard**: 3 additions (for bits 0,1,2 being 1) + 3 shifts = 3 operations.

**Booth**: 1 subtraction (at position 0, start of run) + 1 addition (at position 3, end of run) + 1 shift = 2 operations.

For a multiplier like 0111111110, standard requires many additions, while Booth requires only 2 operations regardless of run length.

### 7. Disadvantages

1. Variable number of operations (worst case: alternating 1s and 0s like 01010101 requires more operations than standard).
2. More complex control logic.
3. Does not improve worst-case performance.

### 8. Modified Booth Algorithm (Radix-4)

Modified Booth's algorithm (also called Booth-2) examines **3 bits** at a time and encodes them into one of 5 operations: {-2, -1, 0, +1, +2} x M. This halves the number of iterations.

#### Radix-4 Booth Encoding

| Q2i+1 | Q2i | Q2i-1 | Operation          |
|-------|-----|-------|--------------------|
| 0     | 0   | 0     | Add 0              |
| 0     | 0   | 1     | Add +M             |
| 0     | 1   | 0     | Add +M             |
| 0     | 1   | 1     | Add +2M (M << 1)   |
| 1     | 0   | 0     | Add -2M            |
| 1     | 0   | 1     | Add -M             |
| 1     | 1   | 0     | Add -M             |
| 1     | 1   | 1     | Add 0              |

- For an n-bit multiplier, only ceil(n/2) iterations are needed.
- +2M is a left shift of M by 1 (easy in hardware).
- -2M is twos complement of (M << 1).

**Example**: Multiply using radix-4 Booth for n=8: only 4 iterations instead of 8.

## Practice Problems

1. **Booth recoding**: Recode the multiplier 01110 (14) into Booth digits. Show the operation at each step.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Q = 01110, Q-1 = 0.
     1: (0,0) -> 0; 1: (1,0) -> -M; 1: (1,1) -> 0; 1: (1,1) -> 0; 0: (0,1) -> +M.
     Operations: -M at pos 1, +M at pos 4. Result = M x (-2 + 16) = 14M. Correct.
</details>

2. **Booth multiplication**: Compute (-5) x (-3) using 4-bit Booth algorithm.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
M = 1011 (-5), Q = 1101 (-3). Booth operations on Q=1101 with Q-1=0:
     (1,0) -> -M = 0101 (+5)
     (0,1) -> +M = 1011 (-5)
     (1,0) -> -M = 0101
     (1,1) -> 0
     After algorithm: Product = 0000 1111 = +15. Check: (-5) x (-3) = 15.
</details>

3. **Booth advantage**: Explain why Booth's algorithm is efficient for multiplier 0011111110.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
The multiplier has a long run of 1s. Standard shift-and-add would require 7 additions. Booth requires only 2 operations: -M at the start of the run (bit 1, since Q1=1 and Q0=0) and +M at the end (bit 8, since Q9=0 and Q8=1). Run length doesn't affect operation count.
</details>

4. **Radix-4 encoding**: For multiplier Q = 011011, encode using radix-4 Booth. Show the operations.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Group bits (with Q-1=0): (0,1,1) -> +2M, (0,1,0) -> +M. Operations: +2M and +M, each shifted appropriately. 2 iterations instead of 6.
</details>

5. **Limitation**: When does Booth's algorithm perform worse than standard shift-and-add?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
When the multiplier has alternating 1s and 0s (e.g., 01010101), every bit pair is a (1,0) or (0,1) transition, requiring an add/sub per bit. Standard shift-and-add would also add per 1 bit, which is half the bits. Both are similar, but Booth requires both addition and subtraction hardware, making the control more complex.
