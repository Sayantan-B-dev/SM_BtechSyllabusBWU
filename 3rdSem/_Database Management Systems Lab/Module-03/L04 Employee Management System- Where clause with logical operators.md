## Lab Objectives

- Use logical operators AND, OR, and NOT in WHERE clauses.
- Combine multiple conditions to filter employee records precisely.
- Examples: employees in IT AND salary > 50000, employees in Finance OR Sales.

## Theory / Concept

Logical operators combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. AND returns rows when all conditions are true. OR returns rows when at least one condition is true. NOT negates a condition. Operator precedence: NOT is evaluated first, then AND, then OR. Use parentheses to override the default precedence and make conditions clear.

## SQL Code

```sql
USE EmployeeDB;

-- AND: Employees in IT department AND salary greater than 90000
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 90000;

-- OR: Employees in Finance OR Sales department
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';

-- AND + OR combination: IT employees with high salary OR any HR employee
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE (department = 'IT' AND salary > 80000) OR department = 'HR';

-- NOT: Employees NOT in IT department
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE NOT department = 'IT';

-- NOT with AND: Employees who are NOT in IT AND have salary > 70000
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE NOT department = 'IT' AND salary > 70000;

-- Using parentheses for clarity
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE (department = 'IT' OR department = 'Finance') AND salary > 75000;

-- Complex condition: employees with salary > 60000 AND (dept IT OR dept Sales)
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > 60000 AND (department = 'IT' OR department = 'Sales');

-- NOT with multiple conditions
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE NOT (department = 'HR' OR department = 'Finance');
```
