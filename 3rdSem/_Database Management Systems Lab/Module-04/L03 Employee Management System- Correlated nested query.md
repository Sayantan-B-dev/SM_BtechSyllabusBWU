## Lab Objectives

- Understand correlated subqueries where the inner query references the outer query.
- Find employees earning more than the average salary of their own department.
- Use EXISTS with correlated subqueries for existence checks.

## Theory / Concept

A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. It is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query. Unlike a simple subquery, a correlated subquery cannot be executed independently. EXISTS with a correlated subquery is efficient for checking whether related rows exist. Performance consideration: correlated subqueries can be slow on large datasets; JOINs often perform better.

## SQL Code

```sql
USE EmployeeDB;

-- Correlated subquery: employees earning more than avg salary of their department
SELECT e1.emp_name, e1.department, e1.salary
FROM Employee e1
WHERE e1.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.department = e1.department
)
ORDER BY e1.department;

-- Same query with department names from Department table
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name, e.salary
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
)
ORDER BY d.dept_name;

-- EXISTS with correlated subquery: employees who are working on at least one project
SELECT e.emp_name, e.department
FROM Employee e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Works_On w
    WHERE w.emp_id = e.emp_id
);

-- NOT EXISTS: employees working on NO projects
SELECT e.emp_name, e.department
FROM Employee e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Works_On w
    WHERE w.emp_id = e.emp_id
);

-- EXISTS: departments that have at least one employee
SELECT d.dept_name
FROM Department d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
);

-- NOT EXISTS: departments with no employees
SELECT d.dept_name
FROM Department d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
);

-- Correlated subquery with HAVING: departments where max salary > 2x min salary
SELECT d.dept_name
FROM Department d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
    GROUP BY e.dept_id
    HAVING MAX(e.salary) > 2 * MIN(e.salary)
);

-- Correlated: employees who have the highest salary in their department
SELECT e.emp_name, e.department, e.salary
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary = (
    SELECT MAX(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.department = e.department
)
ORDER BY e.department;
```

## Expected Output

```

FROM Employee e1 WHERE e1.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e2.department = e1.department
) ORDER BY e1.department;

## Homework / Practice

1. Write a correlated subquery to find employees who have worked more hours than the average hours of all employees on the same project.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   SELECT w1.emp_id, w1.project_id, w1.hours_worked FROM Works_On w1 WHERE w1.hours_worked > (SELECT AVG(w2.hours_worked) FROM Works_On w2 WHERE w2.project_id = w1.project_id);
   </details>

2. Use EXISTS to find all projects that have at least 2 employees assigned.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   SELECT p.project_id, p.project_name FROM Project p WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Works_On w WHERE w.project_id = p.project_id GROUP BY w.project_id HAVING COUNT(w.emp_id) >= 2);
   </details>

3. Write a correlated subquery to find employees whose salary is less than the average salary of employees in the same job_role.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   SELECT e1.emp_name, e1.job_role, e1.salary FROM Employee e1 WHERE e1.salary < (SELECT AVG(e2.salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e2.job_role = e1.job_role);
   </details>
