## Lab Objectives

- Create views using CREATE VIEW to simplify complex queries.
- Query data from views as if they were regular tables.
- Use WITH CHECK OPTION to enforce conditions on view modifications.

## Theory / Concept

A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data physically; it stores the query definition. Views simplify security by restricting access to specific columns or rows. WITH CHECK OPTION ensures that any INSERT or UPDATE through the view satisfies the view's WHERE condition. Views can be used like tables in SELECT, JOIN, and subquery operations.

## SQL Code

```sql
USE EmployeeDB;

-- Create a view for high-salary employees (salary > 90000)
CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department, job_role, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > 90000
WITH CHECK OPTION;

-- Select from the view
SELECT * FROM HighSalaryEmployees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Create a view for department summary
CREATE VIEW DepartmentSummary AS
SELECT
    d.dept_id,
    d.dept_name,
    d.location,
    COUNT(e.emp_id) AS employee_count,
    AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary,
    SUM(e.salary) AS total_salary
FROM Department d
LEFT JOIN Employee e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_id, d.dept_name, d.location;

-- Select from department summary view
SELECT * FROM DepartmentSummary ORDER BY employee_count DESC;

-- Create a view for active project assignments
CREATE VIEW ActiveProjectAssignments AS
SELECT
    e.emp_name,
    p.project_name,
    w.role,
    w.hours_worked,
    p.status
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Works_On w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id
INNER JOIN Project p ON w.project_id = p.project_id
WHERE p.status = 'Active';

-- Select from the view
SELECT * FROM ActiveProjectAssignments;

-- View for IT department employees only
CREATE VIEW ITEmployees AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, job_role, salary, hire_date
FROM Employee
WHERE department = 'IT'
WITH CHECK OPTION;

-- Select from IT view
SELECT * FROM ITEmployees;

-- View with renamed columns
CREATE VIEW EmployeeContactInfo AS
SELECT emp_name AS Name, email AS Email, phone AS Phone, department AS Department
FROM Employee;

SELECT * FROM EmployeeContactInfo WHERE Department = 'Finance';

-- Show all views in the database
SHOW FULL TABLES IN EmployeeDB WHERE TABLE_TYPE LIKE 'VIEW';
```

## Expected Output

## Homework / Practice

1. Create a view named `SalesHighPerformers` that shows sales employees with salary > 70000. Use WITH CHECK OPTION.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   CREATE VIEW SalesHighPerformers AS SELECT emp_id, emp_name, job_role, salary FROM Employee WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 70000 WITH CHECK OPTION;
   </details>

2. Create a view that joins Employee, Department, and Works_On to show a complete employee work profile.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   CREATE VIEW EmployeeWorkProfile AS SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.job_role, e.salary, d.dept_name, d.location, p.project_name, w.role AS project_role, w.hours_worked FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id INNER JOIN Works_On w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id INNER JOIN Project p ON w.project_id = p.project_id;
   </details>

3. Try inserting a record into HighSalaryEmployees with salary = 85000. What happens? Explain why.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   INSERT INTO HighSalaryEmployees (emp_id, emp_name, department, job_role, salary) VALUES (20, 'Test User', 'IT', 'Tester', 85000); This insertion FAILS because the view HighSalaryEmployees was created WITH CHECK OPTION and its WHERE condition is salary > 90000. The value 85000 does not satisfy the condition, so MySQL rejects the insert to enforce the view's filter.
   </details>
