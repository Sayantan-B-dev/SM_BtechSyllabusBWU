## Lab Objectives

- Understand INNER JOIN and its use in combining related tables.
- Join Employee with Department to display employee names along with their department names.
- Write queries that use table aliases for readability.

## Theory / Concept

JOINs combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. INNER JOIN returns only rows where there is a match in both tables. The syntax is: SELECT columns FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column. Table aliases (e.g., e for Employee, d for Department) make queries shorter and more readable. Always qualify column names with table aliases when they appear in multiple tables.

## SQL Code

```sql
USE EmployeeDB;

-- Simple INNER JOIN: employee names with department names
SELECT e.emp_name, e.job_role, e.salary, d.dept_name, d.location
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
ORDER BY d.dept_name, e.emp_name;

-- INNER JOIN with WHERE filter
SELECT e.emp_name, e.salary, d.dept_name
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > 80000
ORDER BY e.salary DESC;

-- INNER JOIN with aggregate
SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(e.emp_id) AS employee_count, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Department d
INNER JOIN Employee e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name
ORDER BY employee_count DESC;

-- Joining multiple tables (Employee -> Works_On -> Project)
SELECT e.emp_name, p.project_name, w.role, w.hours_worked
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Works_On w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id
INNER JOIN Project p ON w.project_id = p.project_id
ORDER BY e.emp_name;

-- INNER JOIN with three tables including Department
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name, p.project_name, w.hours_worked
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
INNER JOIN Works_On w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id
INNER JOIN Project p ON w.project_id = p.project_id
WHERE p.status = 'Active'
ORDER BY w.hours_worked DESC;

-- Self-contained example with a simpler dataset
SELECT e.emp_name AS employee, d.dept_name AS department, e.salary
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.city = 'New York';
```

## Expected Output

```

FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
ORDER BY d.dept_name, e.emp_name;

## Homework / Practice

1. Write an INNER JOIN query to display all employees along with their department names and the names of projects they are working on.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name, p.project_name FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id INNER JOIN Works_On w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id INNER JOIN Project p ON w.project_id = p.project_id;
   </details>

2. Find the total hours worked by each department on all projects using INNER JOIN and aggregation.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   SELECT d.dept_name, SUM(w.hours_worked) AS total_hours FROM Department d INNER JOIN Employee e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id INNER JOIN Works_On w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id GROUP BY d.dept_name;
   </details>

3. Use INNER JOIN to list employees who are working on projects with a budget greater than 100000.
   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>
   SELECT DISTINCT e.emp_name, p.project_name, p.budget FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Works_On w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id INNER JOIN Project p ON w.project_id = p.project_id WHERE p.budget > 100000;
   </details>
