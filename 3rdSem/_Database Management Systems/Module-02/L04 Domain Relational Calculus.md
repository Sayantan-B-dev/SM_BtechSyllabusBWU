## What is Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)?

Domain Relational Calculus is a **declarative** query language that uses **domain variables** (variables that range over individual attribute values, not entire tuples).

**Notation:** `{ <x1, x2, ..., xn> | COND(x1, x2, ..., xn) }`

This reads as: "The set of all n-tuples `<x1, x2, ..., xn>` such that the condition `COND` is satisfied."

Each `xi` is a domain variable that takes values from the domain of the i-th attribute in the result.

## DRC vs TRC: Key Differences

| Aspect | Tuple Calculus (TRC) | Domain Calculus (DRC) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Variable ranges over | Entire tuples | Individual attribute values |
| Variable notation | `t` where `t.Attr` | `<x1, x2, ..., xn>` |
| Condition syntax | `Relation(t)` | `Relation(<x1, x2, ..., xn>)` |
| Quantification | `EXISTS t` or `FORALL t` | `EXISTS x` or `FORALL x` |

## Sample Data

`EMPLOYEE(EmpID, Name, Dept, Salary)`:

| EmpID | Name | Dept | Salary |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 101 | Alice | IT | 60000 |
| 102 | Bob | HR | 45000 |
| 103 | Charlie | IT | 55000 |
| 104 | Diana | Finance | 70000 |

---

## Simple DRC Queries

**Query 1:** Find all employee IDs and names.

```
{ <id, name> | EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) }
```

Result: `<101, Alice>, <102, Bob>, <103, Charlie>, <104, Diana>`

**Query 2:** Find the names of employees in the IT department.

```
{ <name> | EXISTS id, dept, salary (EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) AND dept = 'IT') }
```

Note: Variables not needed in the output are existentially quantified.

**Query 3:** Find all details of employees earning > 50000.

```
{ <id, name, dept, salary> | EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) AND salary > 50000 }
```

Result: Alice (101), Charlie (103), Diana (104).

## Using EXISTS and FORALL in DRC

### Existential Quantifier (EXISTS)

**Query 4:** Find employees whose department is located in New York.

Using `DEPARTMENT(Dept, Location, Budget)`:

```
{ <id, name, dept, salary> | EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) AND
  EXISTS loc, budget (DEPARTMENT(<dept, loc, budget>) AND loc = 'New York') }
```

Result: Alice, Charlie, Diana.

### Universal Quantifier (FORALL)

**Query 5:** Find departments where ALL employees earn > 50000.

```
{ <dept> | EXISTS loc, budget (DEPARTMENT(<dept, loc, budget>)) AND
  FORALL id, name, salary (EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) => salary > 50000) }
```

Result: Finance (the only department where every employee has salary > 50000).

---

## DRC with Multiple Relations

**Query 6:** Find employee names and their department locations.

```
{ <name, loc> | EXISTS id, dept, salary, budget
   (EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) AND
    DEPARTMENT(<dept, loc, budget>)) }
```

Result:
```
Alice, New York
Bob, Chicago
Charlie, New York
Diana, New York
```

**Query 7:** Find employees who earn more than Bob.

```
{ <id, name, dept, salary> | EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) AND
  EXISTS id2, dept2, salary2 (EMPLOYEE(<id2, 'Bob', dept2, salary2>) AND salary > salary2) }
```

Result: Alice (60000 > 45000), Charlie (55000 > 45000), Diana (70000 > 45000).

---

## Safe Expressions in DRC

Same rule as TRC: an expression is safe if it guarantees a finite result.

**Unsafe DRC example:**
```
{ <x, y> | NOT EMPLOYEE(<x, y, z, w>) }
```
This would try to enumerate all pairs that are NOT employee records -- infinite.

**Safe DRC rule:** Every variable in the result must appear in at least one positive relation predicate.

## Comparison: RA vs TRC vs DRC

| Feature | Relational Algebra | Tuple Calculus | Domain Calculus |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Type | Procedural | Declarative | Declarative |
| Variables | None | Tuple variables | Domain variables |
| Quantifiers | None | EXISTS, FORALL | EXISTS, FORALL |
| Notation | Operators | `{t \| COND(t)}` | `{<x1,...,xn> \| COND}` |
| Expressiveness | Equivalent | Equivalent | Equivalent |
| SQL inspiration | FROM/JOIN | SELECT-FROM-WHERE | -- |

**Codd's Theorem:** RA, TRC, and DRC are all equally expressive (they define the same class of queries, namely the domain-independent relational queries).

---

## Worked Example: Complex Query in DRC

**Query:** Find pairs of employees (by name) where the first earns more than the second, and they work in the same department.

```
{ <name1, name2> | EXISTS id1, dept1, sal1, id2, dept2, sal2
   (EMPLOYEE(<id1, name1, dept1, sal1>) AND
    EMPLOYEE(<id2, name2, dept2, sal2>) AND
    dept1 = dept2 AND
    sal1 > sal2) }
```

Result:
```
Alice, Bob (IT vs HR -- actually different depts, so no)
```

Let's trace with the actual data. The only same-department pairs:

- IT: Alice(60000) > Charlie(55000) -> `<Alice, Charlie>`
- IT: Charlie(55000) > Eve(48000) -> `<Charlie, Eve>` (if Eve exists with 48000 in IT)
- No other same-department salary differences.

## Practice Problems

1. Write a DRC query to find the names of all departments.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
`{ <dept> | DEPARTMENT(<dept, loc, budget>) }`
</details>

2. Write a DRC query to find employee IDs of employees who earn less than 50000.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
`{ <id> | EXISTS name, dept, salary (EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) AND salary < 50000) }`
</details>

3. Write a DRC query to find the names of employees who work in a department with budget > 300000.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
`{ <name> | EXISTS id, dept, salary, loc, budget (EMPLOYEE(<id, name, dept, salary>) AND DEPARTMENT(<dept, loc, budget>) AND budget > 300000) }`
</details>

4. What is the key difference between TRC and DRC?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
TRC uses tuple variables that range over entire tuples (e.g., `t.Name`); DRC uses domain variables that range over individual attribute values (e.g., `<name, ...>`).
</details>

5. Express the query "Find names of employees who work in ALL departments" in DRC (or explain why it cannot be expressed safely).
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
This is difficult because an employee cannot work in ALL departments -- each employee belongs to exactly one department in our schema. A more realistic version: "Find employees who have ALL skills" requires division, which DRC can express using FORALL but it is complex.
