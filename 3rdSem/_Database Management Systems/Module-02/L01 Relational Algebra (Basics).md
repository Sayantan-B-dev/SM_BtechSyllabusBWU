## What is Relational Algebra?

Relational algebra is a **procedural query language** for the relational model. It describes *how* to retrieve data by specifying a sequence of operations on relations (tables). The output of every operation is another relation -- this property is called **closure**.

Relational algebra forms the theoretical foundation for SQL. Every SQL query can be translated into an equivalent relational algebra expression.

## Basic Operations

There are five basic operations in relational algebra:

| Operation | Symbol | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Select | `sigma` | Choose rows (horizontal subset) |
| Project | `pi` | Choose columns (vertical subset) |
| Rename | `rho` | Rename a relation or its attributes |
| Union | `cup` | Combine tuples from two relations |
| Set Difference | `-` | Tuples in one relation but not another |
| Cartesian Product | `times` | Combine every tuple of one with every tuple of another |

This lecture covers **SELECT, PROJECT, and RENAME**. The set operations and joins are covered in L02.

## SELECT Operation (`sigma`)

The SELECT operation selects **rows** (tuples) that satisfy a given predicate.

**Notation:** `sigma_condition(Relation)`

**Example:** Given an `EMPLOYEE` table:

| EmpID | Name | Dept | Salary |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 101 | Alice | IT | 60000 |
| 102 | Bob | HR | 45000 |
| 103 | Charlie | IT | 55000 |
| 104 | Diana | Finance | 70000 |

Find all employees in the IT department:

`sigma_Dept = 'IT'(EMPLOYEE)`

Result:

| EmpID | Name | Dept | Salary |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 101 | Alice | IT | 60000 |
| 103 | Charlie | IT | 55000 |

Find employees with salary > 50000:

`sigma_Salary > 50000(EMPLOYEE)`

Result:

| EmpID | Name | Dept | Salary |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 101 | Alice | IT | 60000 |
| 103 | Charlie | IT | 55000 |
| 104 | Diana | Finance | 70000 |

**Compound conditions** use logical connectives AND (^), OR (v), NOT (~):

`sigma_Dept = 'IT' ^ Salary > 50000(EMPLOYEE)`

Result:

| EmpID | Name | Dept | Salary |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 101 | Alice | IT | 60000 |
| 103 | Charlie | IT | 55000 |

**Properties of SELECT:**
- Commutative: `sigma_c1(sigma_c2(R)) = sigma_c2(sigma_c1(R))`
- Cascading: `sigma_c1 AND c2(R) = sigma_c1(sigma_c2(R))`
- SELECT size is always <= original relation size (monotonic reduction)

---

## PROJECT Operation (`pi`)

The PROJECT operation selects **columns** (attributes) from a relation.

**Notation:** `pi_A1, A2, ..., An(Relation)`

**Example:** Get only the Name and Salary of all employees:

`pi_Name, Salary(EMPLOYEE)`

Result:

| Name | Salary |
|------|--------|
| Alice | 60000 |
| Bob | 45000 |
| Charlie | 55000 |
| Diana | 70000 |

**Duplicate elimination:** By default, PROJECT removes duplicate tuples. If two employees have the same name and salary, only one row appears.

Get distinct departments:

`pi_Dept(EMPLOYEE)`

Result:

| Dept |
|------|
| IT |
| HR |
| Finance |

**Properties of PROJECT:**
- The number of tuples in `pi` projection is <= number in original (due to duplicate elimination)
- `pi` is not commutative: `pi_A(pi_B(R))` is valid only if A is subset of B

---

## Combining SELECT and PROJECT

We can compose operations. Find the **names of employees in IT**:

`pi_Name(sigma_Dept = 'IT'(EMPLOYEE))`

Step 1: `sigma_Dept = 'IT'(EMPLOYEE)` gives:

| EmpID | Name | Dept | Salary |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 101 | Alice | IT | 60000 |
| 103 | Charlie | IT | 55000 |

Step 2: `pi_Name` on the above gives:

| Name |
|------|
| Alice |
| Charlie |

---

## RENAME Operation (`rho`)

The RENAME operation gives a name to the result of an expression. It is essential for self-joins and complex queries.

**Notation:** `rho_S(B1, B2, ..., Bn)(R)` renames relation R to S and its attributes to B1, B2, ..., Bn.

**Examples:**

1. Rename only the relation: `rho_IT_Dept(sigma_Dept = 'IT'(EMPLOYEE))`

2. Rename relation and attributes: `rho_E2(ID, Name, Dept, Salary)(EMPLOYEE)` creates a copy named E2 with attribute names ID, Name, Dept, Salary.

3. Rename using assignment: `Temp = sigma_Salary > 50000(EMPLOYEE)` This assigns the result to a temporary relation name.

## Worked Example

**Problem:** Consider `STUDENT(RollNo, Name, Age, Major)`. Find the names of students who are older than 20 and majoring in CS.

**Solution:**
1. Select rows: `sigma_Age > 20 AND Major = 'CS'(STUDENT)`
2. Project names: `pi_Name(sigma_Age > 20 AND Major = 'CS'(STUDENT))`

**Sample Data:**

| RollNo | Name | Age | Major |
|--------|------|-----|-------|
| 1 | Ram | 21 | CS |
| 2 | Shyam | 19 | Math |
| 3 | Sita | 22 | CS |
| 4 | Gita | 20 | Physics |

Step 1: `sigma_Age > 20 AND Major = 'CS'(STUDENT)`

| RollNo | Name | Age | Major |
|--------|------|-----|-------|
| 1 | Ram | 21 | CS |
| 3 | Sita | 22 | CS |

Step 2: `pi_Name` gives:

| Name |
|------|
| Ram |
| Sita |

## Summary Table

| Operation | Symbol | Effect | Unary/Binary |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| SELECT | `sigma` | Horizontal subset (rows) | Unary |
| PROJECT | `pi` | Vertical subset (columns) | Unary |
| RENAME | `rho` | Rename relation/attributes | Unary |

## Practice Problems

1. Given `PRODUCT(ProdID, Name, Price, Category)`, write a relational algebra expression to find the names of all products in the 'Electronics' category with a price less than 500.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
`pi_Name(sigma_Category = 'Electronics' AND Price < 500(PRODUCT))`
</details>

2. Given `EMP(EmpID, Name, Dept, Salary, City)`, write RA to find the employee IDs and names of employees who work in 'Sales' OR earn more than 80000.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
`pi_EmpID, Name(sigma_Dept = 'Sales' OR Salary > 80000(EMP))`
</details>

3. What is the difference between SELECT and PROJECT in relational algebra?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
SELECT picks rows (horizontal subset) using a condition; PROJECT picks columns (vertical subset) and removes duplicates.
</details>

4. Show that SELECT is commutative: `sigma_c1(sigma_c2(R)) = sigma_c2(sigma_c1(R))` with a brief explanation.
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Both orderings produce the same set of tuples satisfying both c1 and c2 because AND is commutative.
</details>

5. Given `R(A, B, C)` with tuples `(1,2,3), (1,2,4), (2,3,4)`, what does `pi_A,B(R)` return?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
`(1,2), (2,3)` -- note that tuples `(1,2,3)` and `(1,2,4)` collapse to `(1,2)` once after projection, and `(2,3,4)` gives `(2,3)`.
