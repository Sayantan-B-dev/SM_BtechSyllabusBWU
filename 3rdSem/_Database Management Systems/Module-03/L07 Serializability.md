## Introduction

When multiple transactions execute concurrently, the DBMS must ensure that the result is **correct** -- equivalent to some serial execution of those transactions. **Serializability** is the concept that defines this correctness criterion.

### Key Questions

1. Given a concurrent execution of transactions, is it correct?
2. How can we formally verify that a schedule is serializable?
3. How can the DBMS ensure that only serializable schedules are produced?

---

## Schedule

A **schedule** is a chronological sequence of operations (read, write, commit, abort) from a set of transactions. It shows the order in which operations are executed by the system.

### Notation

- `r_T(X)`: Transaction T reads data item X.
- `w_T(X)`: Transaction T writes data item X.
- `c_T`: Transaction T commits.
- `a_T`: Transaction T aborts.

### Example: Two Transactions

```
T1: read(A); write(A); read(B); write(B);
T2: read(A); write(A); read(B); write(B);
```

### Serial Schedule

In a **serial schedule**, transactions execute one after another, without interleaving.

```
Serial Schedule S1 (T1 then T2):
  r1(A) w1(A) r1(B) w1(B) c1  r2(A) w2(A) r2(B) w2(B) c2

Serial Schedule S2 (T2 then T1):
  r2(A) w2(A) r2(B) w2(B) c2  r1(A) w1(A) r1(B) w1(B) c1
```

Serial schedules are always correct (assuming each transaction individually preserves consistency). The problem is they offer poor performance -- one transaction must wait for another to complete.

### Non-Serial Schedule

In a **non-serial schedule**, operations from different transactions are interleaved.

```
Non-Serial Schedule S3:
  r1(A) r2(A) w1(A) w2(A) r1(B) w1(B) r2(B) w2(B) c1 c2
```

This schedule interleaves the operations of T1 and T2. Some interleavings produce correct results, and some produce incorrect results.

### Correctness Criterion

A non-serial schedule is **correct** if it produces the same outcome as **some** serial schedule. This property is called **serializability**.

---

## Conflicting Instructions

Two instructions **conflict** if they belong to different transactions, access the same data item, and at least one of them is a write.

### Conflict Types

Let T_i and T_j be two different transactions, and let X be a data item.

| Conflict Type    | Operation Sequence | Description                                     | Example                   |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Read-Write (RW)  | r_i(X), w_j(X)     | T_i reads X, then T_j writes X. T_i's read is before T_j's write. | r1(A), w2(A)             |
| Write-Read (WR)  | w_i(X), r_j(X)     | T_i writes X, then T_j reads X. T_j sees T_i's write.           | w1(A), r2(A)             |
| Write-Write (WW) | w_i(X), w_j(X)     | Both write X. The later write overwrites the earlier.           | w1(A), w2(A)             |

### Why Conflicts Matter

If two operations conflict, their **order** matters. Swapping them can change the outcome of the schedule.

- **Read-Write conflict:** If w_j(X) happens before r_i(X), T_i reads a different value.
- **Write-Read conflict:** If r_j(X) happens before w_i(X), T_j misses T_i's write.
- **Write-Write conflict:** If the order is swapped, the final value of X changes.

### Non-Conflicting Instructions

The following pairs do NOT conflict:
- `r_i(X)` and `r_j(X)` -- Two reads can happen in any order; both read the same value.
- `r_i(X)` and `w_j(Y)` -- Different data items.
- `w_i(X)` and `r_j(Y)` -- Different data items.

## Conflict Serializability

### Definition

A schedule `S` is **conflict serializable** if it is **conflict equivalent** to some serial schedule.

### Conflict Equivalence

Two schedules are **conflict equivalent** if:
1. They involve the same set of transactions.
2. The order of every pair of conflicting operations is the same in both schedules.

If two schedules are conflict equivalent, they produce the same final database state (for any initial state).

### How to Check Conflict Serializability

The standard technique uses a **precedence graph** (also called a serialization graph).

---

## Precedence Graph (Serialization Graph)

### Definition

A precedence graph is a directed graph where:
- **Nodes:** Each transaction is a node (T1, T2, ..., Tn).
- **Edges:** A directed edge T_i --> T_j exists if there is a conflicting pair `op_i` (from T_i) and `op_j` (from T_j) such that `op_i` appears before `op_j` in the schedule.

### Edge Creation Rules

For each pair of conflicting operations (different transactions, same data item, at least one write):
- If `r_i(X)` before `w_j(X)`: edge T_i --> T_j (T_i reads before T_j writes).
- If `w_i(X)` before `r_j(X)`: edge T_i --> T_j (T_i writes before T_j reads).
- If `w_i(X)` before `w_j(X)`: edge T_i --> T_j (T_i writes before T_j writes).

### Theorem

A schedule is **conflict serializable** if and only if its precedence graph has **no cycles**.

If the precedence graph is acyclic, we can perform a **topological sort** to find an equivalent serial schedule.

### Worked Example 1: Serializable Schedule

```
Schedule S:
T1: r(A) w(A)
T2:         r(A) w(A) r(B) w(B)
T3:                     r(B) w(B)

Order of operations:
  r1(A) w1(A) r2(A) w2(A) r3(B) w3(B) r2(B) w2(B) c1 c2 c3
```

**Conflicts:**
- w1(A) before r2(A) --> T1 --> T2 (WR conflict on A)
- w2(A) before ... no other write on A from T3, so no conflict.
- w3(B) before r2(B) --> T3 --> T2 (WR conflict on B)
- Also w2(B) after w3(B) and r3(B)? Let's check all conflicts systematically:

| Operations | Conflict Type | Edge     |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| w1(A), r2(A) | WR          | T1 -> T2 |
| w3(B), r2(B) | WR          | T3 -> T2 |

Graph:
```
T1 --> T2 <-- T3
```

No cycles. Serializable. Equivalent serial schedule: T1, T3, T2 or T3, T1, T2.

### Worked Example 2: Non-Serializable Schedule

```
Schedule S':
T1: r(A) w(A) r(B) w(B)
T2: r(A) w(A) r(B) w(B)

Order:
  r1(A) w1(A) r2(A) w2(A) r2(B) w2(B) r1(B) w1(B) c1 c2
```

**Conflicts on A:**
- w1(A) before r2(A) --> T1 -> T2

**Conflicts on B:**
- w2(B) before r1(B) --> T2 -> T1

Graph:
```
T1 <--> T2 (cycle!)
```

Cycle detected. Schedule S' is **NOT conflict serializable**. This schedule produces a different result than any serial schedule.

Let's verify. In serial T1->T2:
- T1 reads A (old), writes A. T1 reads B (old), writes B.
- T2 reads A (T1's version), writes A. T2 reads B (T1's version), writes B.

In schedule S':
- T1 reads A (old). T1 writes A.
- T2 reads A (T1's version). T2 writes A.
- T2 reads B (old). T2 writes B.
- T1 reads B (T2's version). T1 writes B.

Final state: A = T2's write, B = T1's write. Different from T1->T2 (where A = T2's write, B = T2's write) and from T2->T1 (where A = T1's write, B = T1's write). So it's not equivalent to either serial schedule.

---

## View Serializability

### Motivation

Conflict serializability is a sufficient condition for correctness, but it is **not necessary**. Some schedules that are not conflict serializable are still correct (produce the same result as a serial schedule).

**View serializability** is a broader condition. A schedule is view serializable if it is view-equivalent to some serial schedule.

### View Equivalence

Two schedules S and S' are **view equivalent** if:

1. **Same read operations:** For each data item X, if T_i reads the initial value of X in S, then T_i also reads the initial value of X in S'.
2. **Same dependency:** For each data item X, if T_i reads X after T_j writes X in S, then the same holds in S'.
3. **Same final writes:** For each data item X, the transaction that performs the final write of X in S must be the same as in S'.

### View Serializability Condition

A schedule is **view serializable** if it is view-equivalent to some serial schedule.

### Example: View Serializable but Not Conflict Serializable

```
Schedule S:
T1: w(X)               c1
T2:     w(X) w(Y)      c2
T3:          r(X) w(Y)     c3

Order:
  w1(X) w2(X) w2(Y) r3(X) w3(Y) c1 c2 c3
```

**Conflicts:**
- w1(X) before w2(X) --> T1 -> T2
- w2(X) before r3(X) --> T2 -> T3
- w2(Y) before w3(Y) --> T2 -> T3

Graph:
```
T1 --> T2 --> T3
```
No cycle. Actually, this IS conflict serializable. Let me find a non-CSR but view-serializable example.

### Classic Example: Blind Writes

```
Schedule S:
T1: w(X)
T2: w(X) w(Y)
T3: w(Y)

Order:
  w1(X) w2(X) w2(Y) w3(Y)
```

Wait, we need reads. Consider:

```
Schedule S:
T1: w(A)
T2: w(A) w(B)
T3: w(B)
T4: r(A) r(B)

Execution: w1(A) w2(A) w2(B) w3(B) r4(A) r4(B)
```

Conflicts:
- w1(A) before w2(A) -> T1->T2
- w2(B) before w3(B) -> T2->T3
- w2(A) before r4(A) -> T2->T4
- w3(B) before r4(B) -> T3->T4

Graph: T1->T2->T3->T4 and T2->T4. No cycle. CSR.

The classic non-CSR but view-serializable case involves **blind writes** (writes without a preceding read):

```
T1: r(A) w(A)           -- update A
T2:           w(A)      -- blind write of A
T3:                 r(A) w(A) -- update A

Schedule S:
  r1(A) w1(A) w2(A) r3(A) w3(A)
```

Conflicts:
- w1(A) before w2(A) -> T1->T2
- w2(A) before r3(A) -> T2->T3
- w1(A) before r3(A) could also give T1->T3? No, because we only add edges for conflicting pairs in direct order. Actually r1(A) happens before w2(A)? No, r1(A) and w2(A) -- r1 read, w2 writes. Conflict: r1(A), w2(A) -> T1->T2. 

Graph: T1->T2->T3. No cycle. Hmm.

Let me use the textbook example:

```
T1: w(X)        -- blind write
T2: w(X) w(Y)   -- blind writes
T3: r(X) r(Y) w(Y) -- read X and Y, write Y

Schedule S:
  w1(X) w2(X) w2(Y) r3(X) r3(Y) w3(Y)
```

Conflicts for X: w1(X), w2(X) -> T1->T2. w2(X), r3(X) -> T2->T3.
Conflicts for Y: w2(Y), r3(Y) -> T2->T3. r3(Y), w3(Y) -> T3->T3? No, same transaction. w2(Y), w3(Y) -> T2->T3.

Graph: T1 -> T2 -> T3. No cycle. CSR.

Let me instead provide the classic example from K&R:

```
T1: r(A) w(A)
T2:       w(A)
T3:           r(A)

Schedule: r1(A) w1(A) w2(A) r3(A)
```

Conflicts:
- r1(A) before w2(A): T1 -> T2
- w1(A) before w2(A): T1 -> T2
- w2(A) before r3(A): T2 -> T3

Graph: T1 -> T2 -> T3. Acyclic. CSR.

The key insight: view serializability is a broader definition, but it is NP-complete to test. In practice, database systems use conflict serializability (which is polynomial-time to test via precedence graph) as the practical correctness criterion.

### Blind Writes

A **blind write** is a write operation performed without reading the data item first (i.e., the new value does not depend on the old value).

Blind writes can cause non-CSR but view-serializable schedules. Consider:

```
T1: w(X)   -- blind write of 5
T2: w(X)   -- blind write of 10
T3: r(X)   -- read X

Schedule: w1(X) w2(X) r3(X)

Conflicts: w1(X) < w2(X) -> T1->T2, w2(X) < r3(X) -> T2->T3
Graph: T1->T2->T3. CSR. OK.

What about:
T1: w(X) w(Y)
T2: w(X) w(Y)
T3: r(X) r(Y)

Schedule: w1(X) w2(X) w1(Y) w2(Y) r3(X) r3(Y)

Is this CSR? Let's check.
Conflicts on X: w1(X) < w2(X) -> T1->T2
Conflicts on Y: w1(Y) < w2(Y) -> T1->T2
Reads: r3(X) is after w2(X) -> T2->T3. r3(Y) is after w2(Y) -> T2->T3.
Graph: T1->T2->T3. CSR.

Hmm. Let me just present the concept clearly.
```

### View Serializability vs Conflict Serializability

- **CSR is a subset of VSR:** Every conflict serializable schedule is also view serializable.
- **VSR is broader:** Some schedules are view serializable but not conflict serializable.
- **Testing complexity:** CSR is polynomial (O(n^2) for precedence graph). VSR is NP-complete.
- **Practical use:** DBMS concurrency control protocols ensure CSR (lock-based, timestamp-based). VSR is mostly a theoretical concept.

## Worked Examples: Precedence Graph Practice

### Example A

```
Schedule:
T1: r(A) r(B)
T2:      w(B)
T3:           r(A)

Execution: r1(A) r1(B) w2(B) r3(A)
```

Conflicts:
- r1(B) before w2(B): T1 -> T2 (RW conflict)
- w2(B) before ? No read of B after.
- No other conflicts.

Graph: T1 -> T2. No cycle. Serializable.

### Example B

```
Schedule:
T1: r(X)
T2: w(X)
T3: w(X)
T1: r(X)

Execution: r1(X) w2(X) w3(X) r1(X) -- wait, T1 has two reads? Let me use distinct transactions.

Better:
T1: r(X)
T2: w(X)
T1: r(X) -- this is the same transaction. So it's just one read in T1, then another later.

Schedule:
T1: r(X)                 r(X)   c1
T2:      w(X)                  c2
T3:           w(X)             c3

Order: r1(X) w2(X) w3(X) r1(X) c1 c2 c3
```

Conflicts:
- r1(X) before w2(X): T1 -> T2
- w2(X) before w3(X): T2 -> T3
- w3(X) before r1(X): T3 -> T1

Graph: T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T1. CYCLE! Not conflict serializable.

### Example C

```
T1: w(A) r(B)
T2: w(B) r(A)

Schedule: w1(A) w2(B) r1(B) r2(A) c1 c2
```

Conflicts:
- w1(A) before r2(A): T1 -> T2 (WR on A)
- w2(B) before r1(B): T2 -> T1 (WR on B)

Graph: T1 <-> T2. CYCLE! Not conflict serializable.

## Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** Consider the schedule: `r1(A) w2(A) w1(A) r2(A)`. Draw the precedence graph and determine if it is conflict serializable.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Conflicts:
- r1(A) before w2(A): T1 -> T2
- w2(A) before w1(A): T2 -> T1
- w1(A) before r2(A): T1 -> T2 (additional)

Graph: T1 <-> T2. Cycle. NOT conflict serializable.
</details>

**Problem 2:** For schedule `w3(A) r1(A) w1(B) r3(B) c1 c3`, draw the precedence graph and find an equivalent serial schedule if one exists.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Conflicts:
- w3(A) before r1(A): T3 -> T1 (WR on A)
- w1(B) before r3(B): T1 -> T3 (WR on B)

Graph: T3 -> T1 -> T3. Cycle. NOT conflict serializable.
</details>

**Problem 3:** Given three transactions T1, T2, T3, what does a cycle in the precedence graph indicate?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

A cycle indicates that the schedule is NOT conflict serializable. There is no way to reorder the operations into a serial schedule that respects all conflict orders. The schedule may produce results that are not equivalent to any serial execution.
</details>

**Problem 4:** Schedule: `r1(A) r2(A) w1(A) w2(A)`. Is it conflict serializable?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Conflicts on A:
- r1(A) before w2(A): T1 -> T2
- r2(A) before w1(A): T2 -> T1
- w1(A) before w2(A): T1 -> T2

Graph: T1 <-> T2. Cycle. NOT conflict serializable.

This is the classic "lost update" scenario:
- T1 reads A (old value), T2 reads A (old value).
- T1 writes A (based on old value), T2 writes A (based on old value). T1's update is lost.
</details>

**Problem 5:** Can a schedule be conflict serializable even if it has a dirty read (read of uncommitted data)?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

Yes. A dirty read does not automatically make a schedule non-serializable. Consider:

```
T1: w(A) r(B) c1
T2: r(A) w(B) c2

Schedule: w1(A) r2(A) w2(B) r1(B) c1 c2
```

Conflicts:
- w1(A) before r2(A): T1 -> T2
- w2(B) before r1(B): T2 -> T1

Cycle! Not CSR. But modify:

```
T1: w(A) c1
T2: r(A) w(B) c2
T3: r(B) c3

Schedule: w1(A) r2(A) c1 w2(B) r3(B) c2 c3
```

Conflicts:
- w1(A) before r2(A): T1 -> T2
- w2(B) before r3(B): T2 -> T3

Graph: T1 -> T2 -> T3. Acyclic. CSR, even though T2 read uncommitted data (A) from T1. This is serializable (equivalent to T1, T2, T3). Dirty reads do not automatically make a schedule non-serializable, but they can lead to cascading aborts.
